**RemembeMe**

*RemmeberMe* is meant to be a site where anyone can create their own profiles and use the build in app that aims to be a location based reminder. Anyone will be able to create their own task list, set up reminders and never forget about shopping to pick up, dry cleaning to drop off or important messages to deliver.

## Design ##

Having a minimal design the site will focus more on functionality.

## Tests ##

I have not undertaken any automated testing and I chose to manually test the site functionality and layout.

Idea üí°: After creating all the templates I wanted to ensure their linkeage and functionality

Test üìù: To test this, I went through each and made sure they were loading correctly.

Result üë∑: All templates loaded as expected in development but one issue appeared after deployment.

Verdict ‚úÖ: This test passed in it's basic form, amendments are required to the "remnider" template as it is not loading correctly.

---

Idea üí°: Once the functionality of the sign up and login were done I wanted to test and see if they work correctly.

Test üìù: To test this, I went through using a different device, created an account and managed to access the rest of the pages.

Result üë∑: Everything worked as expected.

Verdict ‚úÖ: This test passed but further improvements can be made by ensuring the security aspect is kept and the design is more appealing.

---

Idea üí°: A good UX experience is given by interactions with the pages on a website, that's why messages have been implemented in the site.

Test üìù: Testing has been done by confirming every action that should send a message, is doing so.

Result üë∑: Users are receiving success messages for loggin in and out and error messages for incorrect forms.

Verdict ‚úÖ: This test passed and no further corrections are required.

## Issues ##

Issue üêõ: Heroku Deployment failed.
Causeüîß: The Cloudinary environmental variable isn't configured correctly.
Resolution‚úÖ: Removing the variable name from the variable key resolved the issue.

---

Issue üêõ: Heroku CSS file not found while deploying
Causeüîß: The static files path was missing the app name.
Resolution‚úÖ: Adding the app name to the path resolved the issue.



# Unresolved Issues #

1. Sign Up and Login templates do not extend "base.html" and although I have found several solutions online, none worked.
2. The main app functionality has stopped working and can't be accessed at the moment until a fix can be found. **Access** can be gained in the admin section using the  admin credentials.


## Deployment ##

Deploying to Heroku #

This project was produced in GitPod and is deployed on Heroku. This is how to make a copy of this project and deploy it accordingly. The images are hosted on AWS, so you will need to sign up for a AWS account in order to get an API key. I opted to use a gmail account, the settings for which are in the settings.py file. The payment system used is Stripe, which you will need to set up an account for in order to collect the PUBLIC_KEY, PRIVATE_KEY and WebHook keys.

To set it up locally 1 - download the repository using the link at the top of the page, alternatively you can clone it using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/LeVlad/

2 - Set up a virtual environment:

py -m venv venv 3 - Activate the virtual environment:

venv\Scripts\activate Create a project by entering the command: django-admin startproject YOURPROJECTNAMEHERE

Create a new app by entering the comand: py manage.py startapp YOURAPPNAMEHERE

You are now ready to install the packages required to run this program. You can do this by installing the requirements in the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt Next we need to add the following to the list of installed apps in settings.py:

-'cloudinary_storage', -'crispy_forms', -'allauth', -'allauth.account', -'allauth.socialaccount', -'django.contrib.staticfiles', -'django_countries', -'home', -'bag', -'checkout', -'profiles', -'contact', -'yourappname'

You will need to create an env.py file which will contain the following:

os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "your postgresql url which you will find in heroku (see below)" 
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your secret key which will added to heroku" 
os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "your cloudinary api"


Setting up on Heroku:

1 - Set up a (or log into an existing) Heroku account.

2 - Select add new app and give it a unique name

3 - Select 'Resources' and search for/install the Heroku Postgres add-on.

4 - Select 'Settings' and click 'Reveal Config Vars'

5 - You will find the DATABASE URL already added, copy this to the env.py file mentioned previously.

6 - You will need the following config vars:

CLOUDINARY_URL = your API url from cloudinary 
SECRET_KEY = your secret key must match the secret key in your env.py file 
DATABASE_URL = heroku link to your postgres database

Migrate and Run in Gitpod
Finally, all that remains is to makemigration by entering the following command:

python3 manage.py makemigrations Then migrate using the following:

python3 manage.py migrate And run the app locally:

python3 manage.py runserver
